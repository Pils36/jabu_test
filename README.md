<strong>README TO THE TEST...</strong>


<strong>Conceptually How I will structure my data, options and hypothesis</strong>

I believe as the data grows, there will be a little amount of size consumed from the record stored.

In order to make sure that processes are not lagging, we need to reduce the use of looping.

We should also adopt more of using pagination which can also help with performance, so we dont need to return all the data to the view at once.

Structuring my data, it would be in the order of importance, i.e tasks that are pending comes first and then the completed goes to the latter.

This will help the user plan ahead on what is pending.


<strong>Development that i have ENJOYED the most</strong>

Out of many other projects, PaySprint (https://paysprint.ca) happens to have been the most interesting of them all.

<strong>What is PaySprint?</strong>
PaySprint is a subscription based wallet system, that allows user to send and receive money both locally and international.

Aside the integration with third-party payment gateways like Stripe, PayPal, PayStack, Dusupay using RESTFul API, I was also exposed to using SOAP service integration with Money Exchange (MOEX).

Another part of PaySprint was dealing with KYC, and i was able to integrate with ShuftiPro, to verify users identity and have more sanity in the system.

On Saturday 10/12/2022 a press was released on PaySprint and ShuftiPro join forces to provide an automated secure and seamless customer experience

So far, PaySprint has over 13,000 registered users around the globe and i feel like a proud Dad to the growth of the platform.
